0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not deliver


linearXspreadforceY (default : 0.0)
If X-axis movement (left and right) is lost by min/maxoffset, the excess force is deliver to the Y-axis movement (front and rear)
0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not deliver

linearXspreadforceZ (default : 0.0)
If X-axis movement (left and right is lost by min/maxoffset, the excess force is deliver to the Z-axis movement (up and down)
0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not deliver

linearYspreadforceX (default : 0.0)

forceMultipler (default : 1.0) (haven't tested it yet)
Reduces all receive the forces
I think it's thought to be useful when giving physics to those nodes while multiple nodes are connected
0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not deliver

#physics parameters related to collisions

collisionXmaxoffset (default : 100.0)
limit of move to right by collision / recommended to use positive number

collisionXminoffset (default : -100.0)
limit of move to left by collision / recommended to use negative number

collisionYmaxoffset (default : 100.0)
limit of move to front by collision / recommended to use positive number

collisionYminoffset (default : -100.0)
limit of move to rear by collision / recommended to use negative number

collisionZmaxoffset (default : 100.0)
limit of move to up by collision / recommended to use positive number

collisionZminoffset (default : -100.0)
limit of move to down by collision / recommended to use negative number

collisionFriction (default : 0.2)
causes friction and reduces inertia
You can set 0.0 ~ 1.0
larger the value, more drag
smaller the value, more slide

collisionPenetration (default : 0.0)
Adjust the force to push when colliding
You can set 0.0 ~ 1.0 (If exceeds 1, the collision becomes very strange so it don't allow other value)
It affects the actual location of the collider

collisionMultipler (default : 1.0)
Adjust the force to push when colliding
0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not pushed
It's not affects the actual location of the collider

collisionMultiplerRot (default : 1.0)
Set how much more force will be applied to force of rotation when colliding 
0.5 is half, 2 is twice, 0 is not rotate by colliding

collisionElastic (default : 0.0)
Set whether to add elastic collision by collision to the physics calculation in next frame
Unlike other parameters, this is on/off format 
it turns off if value is 0.0 and on if value is 1.0
The physics quality gets better when collision, but sometimes it can occur jitter when collision

#how to set the capsule collider

[NPC L UpperArm [LUar]] #insert defined node name
0.5,0.25,8,4 & 0.5,0.25,18,3.6 | 0.5,0.25,8,4 & 0.5,0.25,18,3.6 
#A center point X position, A center point Y position, A center point Z position, A radius size & B center point X position, B center point Y position, B center point Z position, B radius size
It's like set up two spheres collider, but if combine them with &, it becomes capsule collider
It's basically capsule collider, but also can use as cone collide

I think you already know the meaning of "|" so I'll skip it


#how to add the ground collider
just add NPC Root [Root] to the [ColliderNodes] part, it automatically added ground collision
don't need to set the collider like sphere and capsule

UseParallelProcessingOLD = 3
1 is parallel processing of each node unit
2 is parallel processing of each actor unit
3 is all parallel processing of each actor unit and each node unit

3 has improved performance by 50% to 100% compared to 0 (based on CPU 4770K)

#The above parameters effect to physics by the material of the armour
#the below keywords are for extra manage of those parameters
#It works with the keyword name
#so even if don't have a master plugin(esp/esm/esl)
#just create a new keyword then define the name correctly and attach it then it work
